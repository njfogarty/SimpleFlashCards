# SimpleFlashCards
A primitive command-line flash card application.

This is a special branch for a heavily improved multiplication deck...

Allows the user to specify a number that will be multiplied by 1-12. 
Also asks the user if they would like to restart at the end of a deck, negating the need to re-run the program when a deck is complete.
Does not allow user to specify a different range from 1-12.
