# SimpleFlashCards
A primitive command-line flash card application.

This program is very basic, and not very useful unless you need a very basic set of flash cards.

This is a special branch that will be improved upon for multiplication purposes.

1. Flash cards cannot be modified in any way unless source code is modified.
2. Only supports one deck at a time, or one deck per build.
3. Adding additional cards past the initial 12 is cumbersome.
4. No support for repeating the deck outside of running the program multiple times.
5. No way to sort cards by any sort of difficulty.
